# Week-4-Challenge
Use Jupyter notebook and NumPy, panda library to edit (replace grades of ninth-grade students in Thomas high school with Nah), and then re-perform per-school performance data analysis. The analysis includes the math, reading, and overall passing rate per school comparing to their size, funds, and school type.


## Project Overview and purpose 
Use Python in the Jupyter notebook to read and load the student and school datasheets' data.
- Replace grades of ninth-grade students in Thomas high school with Nah
-Re-perform fundamental data analysis of the school performance result related to schools’ size, fund, and types.
-Determine the best top five and worse top five schools.
-Compare the newer result with the original one
## Resource
-Data Source: student_complete.csv,  school_complete.csv
-Software: Excel, Jupyter notebook, github, gitbash

-district summary: Comparing to the original data analysis, other school performances remain the same in the second data analysis. However,  THS’ reading, math, and overall passing percentage are better 
-school summary: Comparing to the original data analysis, there is no significant difference in the second analysis besides the overall passing percentage is one percent higher in the later analysis.
-After replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores,  Thomas High School’s performance becomes better with its higher reading, math, and overall passing percentage.
-After replacing the ninth-grade scores: 
Math and reading scores by grade seem better 
Scores by school spending seem better in [630-644]group
Scores by school size seem better in the medium-size group
Scores by school type in the character group  
## Summary 
In the second data analysis without 9th grade, THS has a better math passing percentage.
In the second data analysis without 9th grade, THS has a better reading passing percentage.
In the second data analysis without 9th grade, THS has a better overall passing percentage.
In the second data analysis without 9th grade, scores by school size seem better in the medium-size group
